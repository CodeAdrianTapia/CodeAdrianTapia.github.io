                                to Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Hayden Valley, and the Grand
                                Prismatic Spring, among other sights. The Upper Loop hits Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces,

                        <h3><span>1</span> &mdash; West Thumb Geyser Basin</h3>
                        <p>The West Thumb Geyser Basin is located on the shores of Yellowstone Lake. Although this is
                            one of the smallest geyser basins in Yellowstone, it does contain a well-known geothermal
                            feature, the Fishing Cone Geyser.Before 1911, anglers who were fishing in Yellowstone Lake
                            near this geyser would sometimes plunk their catch still on the hook into the cone’s boiling
                            water, effectively cooking it alive. That practice was outlawed in 1911. The West Thumb
                            Basin is also home to several other geysers, bubbling mud pots, and hot springs, including
                            the park’s deepest pool, the Abyss Pool. West Thumb Bay, where this basin is located, gets
                            its name because Yellowstone Lake was described by an early expedition party as looking like
                            a hand. And this western bay was said to look like the thumb of that hand.</p>

                        <h3><span>2</span> &mdash; Mount Washburn</h3>
                        <p>This mountain peak was named for Henry D. Washburn who led the Washburn-Langford-Doane
                            Expedition that explored Yellowstone Park in 1870. Mount Washburn is one of the most popular
                            places to hike in Yellowstone. There are two trails that ascend the mountain — one that
                            starts at the Dunraven Pass Trailhead and another that begins at the Chittenden Road parking
                            lot. Both offer breathtaking views of the surrounding area, but because of their popularity,
                            they can be crowded during the peak tourism season. Although these trails are considered
                            fairly easy, the high elevation does affect some hikers. Wild animals, including mountain
                            goats and bears, can sometimes be seen from these trails.</p>

                        <h3><span>3</span> &mdash; Hayden Valley</h3>
                        <p>Because this valley is centrally, it is one of the most popular places for visitors to go to
                            see wildlife. Large herds of buffalo can often be seen grazing on this valley’s meadows, and
                            it’s not uncommon to spot elk, pronghorn antelopes and bears, as well. Fortunately, there
                            are numerous turnouts in Hayden Valley where visitors can park to get a better view of the
                            picturesque valley and its wildlife. Hayden Valley also boasts two trails where hikers can
                            get an up-close-and personal view of the beautiful area. The Hayden Valley Trail runs from
                            Yellowstone Lake to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and shadows the Yellowstone River.
                            The Mary Mountain Trail follows an old wagon trail and is said to be the park’s most popular
                            trail. Caution must be taken when hiking in the valley, as bears often roam in this area.

                        <p>At Mammoth Hot Springs, steaming hot water flows over travertine terraces, creating a
                            beautiful but otherworldly scene. Some people have even described Mammoth Hot Springs as a
                            cave turned inside out. The Mammoth Hot Springs area is divided into two sections, the Upper
                            and Lower Terraces. Each section contains numerous hot springs and a variety of interesting
                            looking formations. This region of the park is also a good place to look for elk. They can
                            often be seen hanging around the Mammoth Hot Spring visitor center. Though they appear tame,
                            it is best that visitors always give them a wide berth, especially during the fall rutting
                            season when the males can be particularly dangerous. Female elk with babies have also been
                            known to charge visitors if they believe that they are getting too close to their young
                            ones.</p>

                            <p class="icon icon_ql">Wolves are highly social animals and live in packs. Worldwide, pack
                                size will depend on the size and abundance of prey. In Yellowstone, average pack size is
                                10 individuals. The pack is a complex social family, with older members (often the alpha
                                male and alpha female) and subordinates, each having individual personality traits and
                                roles within the pack. Packs defend their territory from other, invading packs by
                                howling and scent-marking with urine.
                                <!--- Research in Yellowstone since reintroduction has
                                highlighted the adaptive value of social living in wolves – from cooperative care of
                                offspring, group hunting of large prey, defense of territory and prey carcasses, and
                                even survival benefits to infirmed individuals.--->

                                (Bison bison) have lived continuously since prehistoric times. Yellowstone bison are
                                exceptional because they comprise the nation’s largest bison population on public land.
                                Unlike most other herds, this population has thousands of individuals that are allowed
                                to roam relatively freely over the expansive landscape of Yellowstone National Park and
                                some nearby areas of Montana. They also exhibit wild behavior like their ancient
                                ancestors, congregating during the breeding season to compete for mates, as well as
                                migration and exploration that result in the use of new habitat areas. These behaviors
                                have enabled the successful restoration of a population that was on the brink of
                                extinction just over a century ago.</p><cite><span class="name">Bison

                            <p class="icon icon_ql">The cougar (Puma concolor), also known as mountain lion, is the one
                                of the largest cats in North America and a top predator native to Greater Yellowstone.
                                (The jaguar, which occurs in New Mexico and Arizona, is larger.) As part of
                                predator-removal campaigns in the early 1900s, cougars and wolves were killed throughout
                                the lower 48 states, including national parks. Wolves (Canis lupus) were eradicated and,
                                although cougars were probably eliminated from Yellowstone, the species survived in the
                                West because of its cryptic nature and preference for rocky, rugged territory where the
                                cats are difficult to track. Eventually the survivors re-established themselves in
                                Yellowstone in the early 1980s, possibly making their way from wilderness areas in
                                central Idaho.

                            <p class="icon icon_ql">Yellowstone is home to two species of bears: grizzly bears and black
                                bears. Of the two species, grizzly bears have a much smaller range across the United
                                States. The grizzly bear is typically larger than the black bear and has a large muscle
                                mass above its shoulders; a concave, rather than straight or convex, facial profile; and
                                much more aggressive behavior. The grizzly bear is a subspecies of brown bear that once
                                roamed large swaths of the mountains and prairies of the American West. Today, the
                                grizzly bear remains in a few isolated locations in the lower 48 states, including
                                Yellowstone.In coastal Alaska and Eurasia, the grizzly bear is known as the brown bear.

                            <p class="icon icon_ql">Elk are the most abundant large mammal found in Yellowstone.
                                European American settlers used the word “elk” to describe the animal, which is the word
                                used in Europe for moose (causing great confusion for European visitors). The Shawnee
                                word “wapiti,” which means “white deer” or “white-rumped deer,” is another name for elk.
                                The North American elk is considered the same species as the red deer of Europe.
                                Due to their huge antlers, bull elk are one of the most photographed animals in
                                Yellowstone. Bull elk begin growing their first set of antlers when they are about one
                                year old. Antler growth is triggered in spring by a combination of two factors: a
                                depression of testosterone levels and lengthening daylight. The first result of this
                                change is the casting or shedding of the previous year’s “rack.” Most bulls drop their
                                antlers in March and April. New growth begins soon after.

                                habitat structure and dynamics through the damming and diverting of streams, and the
                                felling of trees and other woody vegetation. The resulting ponds and flooding help
                                create an environment favorable to willow and aspen, the beavers’ preferred winter foods
                                and used in building their lodges. The territoriality of beavers probably deters two
                                colonies from locating within 165 feet (50 m) of each other, and most streams in the
                                park lack either suitable vegetation or a sufficiently low gradient to provide beavers
                                with habitat, but information about the distribution and number of beaver colonies in
                                the park over time adds to our understanding about the long-term effects of changes in
